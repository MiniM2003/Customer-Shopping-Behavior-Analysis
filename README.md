# Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using a real-world dataset. The goal is to uncover insights about customer preferences, spending patterns, and purchase trends to help drive business decisions. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based data querying, and visualizations using Power BI dashboards.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains information on customer purchases, including demographics, items purchased, purchase amounts, payment methods, shipping types, and review ratings. Key columns include:

      customer_id, age, gender, location
      
      item_purchased, category, size, color, season
      
      purchase_amount, discount_applied, previous_purchases
      
      payment_method, frequency_of_purchases, subscription_status
      
      review_rating, purchase_frequency_days, age_group

The dataset is stored in a CSV file and used for analysis in Python and SQL.

**Tools & Technologies**

  * Python: For data cleaning, EDA, and preprocessing

  * Pandas & NumPy: Handling and manipulating data

  * Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization of trends and patterns

  * MySQL Server: Running SQL queries for deeper analysis

  * Power BI: Building interactive dashboards for insights

  * Jupyter Notebook: Documenting the analysis workflow

**Steps Performed**

1. Data Loading: Import dataset into Python for initial exploration.

2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, inconsistent data, and duplicates.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

     * Analyze customer demographics

     * Identify top-selling products and categories

     * Study purchase patterns and seasonality

4. SQL Queries on MySQL Server:

      * Perform aggregation, segmentation, and trend analysis

      * Query loyal customers, top categories, and revenue by region

      * Data Visualization & Dashboarding:

      * Create interactive Power BI dashboards to present key insights

**Dashboards**

The Power BI dashboards include:

  * Customer Segmentation: New, Returning, and Loyal customers

  * Revenue Analysis: Revenue by category, region, and season

  * Purchase Trends: Frequency of purchases and average purchase amount

  * Discount Impact: Effect of discounts on sales and review ratings

  * Customer Demographics: Age and gender-wise purchase behavior

**Results**

  * Identified the most valuable loyal customers and top-performing product categories.

  * Discovered trends in seasonal purchases and discount-driven sales.

  * Provided actionable insights for marketing strategies and inventory planning.

  * Interactive Power BI dashboard summarizes all findings for easy stakeholder consumption.
